The repository contains all of the software and data which you'll need to run the analysis in the 2nd and 3rd chapters of my PhD thesis, available at: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0qw843w1. These two chapters focus on modeling the gaseous disks and rocky particles which form planets in the disks surrounding young stars, known as protoplanetary disks. In the 2nd chapter of my thesis, I model the evolution of these protoplanetary disks in order to predict where and when the conditions are most favorable for planetary growth. This boils down to growing rocks from asteroid sizes to planet sizes by modeling the interactions between the small particles and the gas which both surround these proto-planets. The software for this 2nd chapter is found in the folder labeled "Massive_Disks". Contained within is a jupyter notebook tutorial, to one through the basics of using this software. The 3rd chapter of my thesis builds on this work, using mostly the same tools to model the growth the planets-to-be from cm sizes to the many km sized asteroids modeled in the 2nd chapter. The 3rd chapter's software is in the folder labeled "Small_Planetesimals", which also includes a jupyter notebook tutorial to describe the software.

If you have any issues running any of these software or analyses, please contact me at tktakaro (at) ucsc.edu.
