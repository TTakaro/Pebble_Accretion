A better understanding of protoplanetary disks is crucial to help astronomers recreate the diversity of exoplanets that we see in our galaxy. An increasing number of studies indicate that these disks may be more massive than was previously thought, suggesting more material available for planetary formation. We apply one such observationally motivated model of protoplanetary disks to our state-of-the-art turbulent pebble accretion model, in order to probe planetary formation in this new parameter regime. Testing a wide range of turbulence strengths in the outer disk, we are able to rapidly grow injected protoplanetary cores, exploring the conditions under which these protoplanets reach the masses needed for runaway gas accretion. This model predicts cores which, upon reaching a minimum mass, grow extremely efficiently to their flow isolation masses, a natural mass at which pebble accretion halts. Depending on when and where in the disk these small protoplanets are injected, some grow to terrestrial planet masses, while others are able to reach masses required to runaway gas accretion.
